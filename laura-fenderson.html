                    This series is an exploration of my youth culture - experiences of community, connection, joy and
                    intimacy- filtered through an introspective lens. My youth has been affected by times of prolonged
                    isolation and uncertainty, this series is my attempt of reclaiming what I know to be true in the
                    beauty of my lived experience. I have used personal photography as the source material for this
                    work. I am interested in photography as a medium as it can provide the viewer an immortalised candid
                    depiction of reality in an objective, unfiltered form. The work explores the aesthetic and
                    philosophical principles of the photograph - with the aim to investigate the way in which the photo
                    has defined my world. This series purposefully moves the photograph into the painted realm in order
                    to offer the images- the people and emotions they reflect- a new reality. I use painterly
                    abstraction to remove these works from the photographic source to allow the painting to become its
                    own kind of reality.</p>

            My work explores the gendered symbolism of domestic functional objects and my connection to them. I create
            familiar objects that are subverted via their affordances in order to recode them from function to
            dysfunction. I am interested in creating objects that silently protest their intended purpose and therefore
            our preconceived notions of how they, and women, should behave.</p>
