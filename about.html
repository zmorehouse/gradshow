                <h2> Message From The Head Of School</h2>
                <hr>
                <h3> On behalf of the Australian National University, School of Art & Design, I am delighted to share
                    with you the work of our 2022 graduating cohort, spanning art history and curatorship, design, and
                    visual arts. </h3>

                <p> Excitedly, the 2022 Graduating Exhibition is open to public! This exhibition marks a tremendous
                    achievement, despite the challenges of the past few years. The exhibition includes work by students
                    completing undergraduate, honours, and postgraduate coursework programs at the School. The School is
                    incredibly proud of all our graduating students for 2022.
                    <br /> <br />
                    As you wander the halls of our heritage building, or as you navigate the online portal, please take
                    your time to explore the showcase. Our student body is diverse and talented and the work shared
                    illustrates a dynamic and creative range – everything from glass, ceramics, textiles, sculpture,
                    photomedia, printmedia & drawing, painting to design, text-based artwork to AI, video and sound
                    installations. We encourage visitors to the exhibition to interrogate the showcase and to spend time
                    with each work, to consider and reflect on how our students have responded to the world around them,
                    through art and design.
                    <br /> <br />
