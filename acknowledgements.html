            <p> The Australian National University acknowledges, celebrates and pays our respects to the Ngunnawal and
                Ngambri people of the Canberra region and to all First Nations Australians on whose traditional lands we
                meet and work, and whose cultures are among the oldest continuing cultures in human history.
            </p>

                The Graduating Exhibition at the ANU School of Art and Design acknowledges the strength and commitment
                of the 2022 cohort of students, who have completed their studies and creative outcomes in often
                challenging times.

            </p>
            <p>
                The richness and diversity of practice seen throughout this exhibition is evident with strong partnering
                of teaching and learning between academics and students, and extends to include technicians, sessional
                staff, professional staff and a broader exchange of ideas within the University.

            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you to our outstanding academics and technical officers for their unwavering support, knowledge,
                skills, stimulation and enthusiasm.

            </p>
            <p>
