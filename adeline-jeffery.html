                    My work investigates the connection between group sharing and healing in response to traumatic life experiences. Those Left Behind draws on the personal recordings of a group of family and friends that have dealt with the loss of a loved one to terminal illness to offer a space in which to reflect and find solace. Asking the question, ‘what do you need to share to find healing,’ I combine ceramic casts of each individual’s arm with their responses, transcribed in my own handwriting, to capture both their personal identity and represent the act of their story becoming merged with my own. Those Left Behind recognises the pain and grief experienced by those who have lost an individual to a terminal illness and is a representation of the healing those involved in the project found as they shared their stories.</p>
